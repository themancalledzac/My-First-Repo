          Edgar Poe was born in Boston, Massachusetts on January 19, 1809, the
          second child of English-born actress Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe and
          actor David Poe Jr. He had an elder brother named William Henry
          Leonard Poe and a younger sister named Rosalie Poe.[6] Their
          grandfather, David Poe Sr., emigrated from County Cavan, Ireland
          around 1750.[7] Edgar may have been named after a character in William
          Shakespeare's King Lear, which the couple were performing in 1809.[8]
          His father abandoned the family in 1810,[9] and his mother died a year
          later from consumption (pulmonary tuberculosis). Poe was then taken
          into the home of John Allan, a successful merchant in Richmond,
          Virginia who dealt in a variety of goods, including cloth, wheat,
          tombstones, tobacco, and slaves.[10] The Allans served as a foster
          family and gave him the name "Edgar Allan Poe",[11] though they never
          formally adopted him.[12]
        </p>
        <p>
          The Allan family had Poe baptized into the Episcopal Church in 1812.
          John Allan alternately spoiled and aggressively disciplined his foster
          son.[11] The family sailed to the United Kingdom in 1815, and Poe
          attended the grammar school for a short period in Irvine, Ayrshire,
          Scotland (where Allan was born) before rejoining the family in London
          in 1816. There he studied at a boarding school in Chelsea until summer
          1817. He was subsequently entered at the Reverend John Bransby's Manor
          House School at Stoke Newington, then a suburb 4 miles (6 km) north of
          London.[13]
        </p>

          Poe moved with the Allans back to Richmond in 1820. In 1824, he served
          as the lieutenant of the Richmond youth honor guard as the city
          celebrated the visit of the Marquis de Lafayette.[14] In March 1825,
          Allan's uncle and business benefactor William Galt died, who was said
          to be one of the wealthiest men in Richmond,[15] leaving Allan several
          acres of real estate. The inheritance was estimated at $750,000
          (equivalent to $17,000,000 in 2019).[16] By summer 1825, Allan
          celebrated his expansive wealth by purchasing a two-story brick house
          called Moldavia.[17]

          Poe may have become engaged to Sarah Elmira Royster before he
          registered at the University of Virginia in February 1826 to study
          ancient and modern languages.[18][19] The university was in its
          infancy, established on the ideals of its founder Thomas Jefferson. It
          had strict rules against gambling, horses, guns, tobacco, and alcohol,
          but these rules were mostly ignored. Jefferson had enacted a system of
          student self-government, allowing students to choose their own
          studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all
          wrongdoing to the faculty. The unique system was still in chaos, and
          there was a high dropout rate.[20] During his time there, Poe lost
          touch with Royster and also became estranged from his foster father
          over gambling debts. He claimed that Allan had not given him
          sufficient money to register for classes, purchase texts, and procure
          and furnish a dormitory. Allan did send additional money and clothes,
          but Poe's debts increased.[21] Poe gave up on the university after a
          year but did not feel welcome returning to Richmond, especially when
          he learned that his sweetheart Royster had married another man,
          Alexander Shelton. He traveled to Boston in April 1827, sustaining
          himself with odd jobs as a clerk and newspaper writer,[22] and he
          started using the pseudonym Henri Le Rennet during this period.[23]
